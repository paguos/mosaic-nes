# Scenarios

## Berlin

The Berlin mosaic scenario is designed to test a configuration where NES sources have a fixed location and a single sink is mounted to a moving vehicle.

| `berlin-range-query`  	| Moving sink submits multiple range queries in a defined interval.    	|


## Barcelona

The Barcelona mosaic scenario is designed to test a topology configuration where both NES sources and the single sink are mounted on moving vehicles.
